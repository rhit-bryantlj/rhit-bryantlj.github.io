        <h1>About</h1>
        <img src="files/avatar.jpg" alt="Personal portrait of Logan Bryant" />
        <p>I am currently a Senior attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology 
            striving to complete a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with 
            a minor in Computer Science. I have had the opportunity to work with 
            many amazing people at Rose class projects and am ready to use the skills I have 
            developed during my time towards a full-time job. I am passionate about working 
            with different types of technology, especially new cutting edge technologies.</p>

        <p>On campus I am apart of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE), 
            Association of Future Alumni (AFA), and CSERVE. For AFA, we reach out to 
            the Rose-Hulman alumni to connect on a professional level and make 
            sure they feel welcome when returning to campus. The group also helps
            to put on a dinner and get together during homecoming for the alumni.
            CSERVE is an organized group that supports Career Services to put on 
            the Career Fair. We help the companies setup and cleanup as well as 
            provide help getting anything they need during the fair. Lastly, PIKE 
            is one of my bigest commitments. I have held the chair as President as well
            as the positions of the Vice President of Enrichment and Brotherhood.</p>
