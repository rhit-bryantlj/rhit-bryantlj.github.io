        <img src="images/avatar.jpg" />
        <p>I am currently a Junior attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology 
            striving to complete a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with 
            a minor in Computer Science. I have had the opportunity to work with 
            many amazing people at Rose class projects and am ready to continue 
            my work experience through internships. I am passionate about working 
            with different types of technology, especially new cutting edge technologies.</p>

        <p>On campus I am apart of the Association of Future Alumni (AFA), CSERVE,
            and the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE). For AFA, we reach out to 
            the Rose-Hulman alumni to connect on a professional level and make 
            sure they feel welcome when returning to campus. The group also helps
            to put on a dinner and get together during homecoming for the alumni.
            CSERVE is an organized group that supports Career Services to put on 
            the Career Fair. We help the companies setup and cleanup as well as 
            provide help getting anything they need durin the fair. Lastly, PIKE 
            is one of my bigest commitments. I am currently the Vice President of 
            Enrichment. This oversees internal affairs between the brothers, sitting
            on the Exec board, and interpreting the bylaws. </p>
